in angular.json file have all project stucture 
in package.json file have all install packages
src/app/app.module.ts file have all used componets and more that we are create and use in 
our project
src/index.html is a starting point of our project in index.html
there is selector <app-root></app-root> this is root of the project and app project componets and more are 
import/used in this file 
this is come from AppComponet Class From app.componets.ts file  

in angular 1 is used js and after anguler 1 come angular 2 thats have typescript language 
and we are using angular 14 that why we are using typescript

we need to learn first
    html
    Css 
    typescript
    and bootstrap css to create our project
    we are created the RestAPI In Python For This Project we Can Change As Per Requirments 
    becouse we Are creating FullStack Application
    ok Then starting

    we can use two ways to create componets 
    in angular manual and with command
    **(ng generate component component-name)**
1 manual 
create component in (create component-name folder) and inside folder 
create component-name.component.ts /html/css files

(in vscode)
in app folder right click and choose new folder name it 
and right click on folder and click new file create components file 
in product folder
this two files requred 
    1 product.component.ts
    2 product.component.html
    and third is optional
    3 product.component.css

write the code of component becouse we are creating manual component in first step1
this code is required to create angular component 

import { Component } from "@angular/core";
@Component({
    selector:"product-component",
    templateUrl:'./product.component.html',
    styleUrls:["product.component.css"]
})
export class ProductComponent{  
}

then import this component in app.module.ts file to initiolize and run the project

now we create a manual component lets create with command first open terminal/command prompt
this is command to create component  ng generate component component-name
also we have shortcut for this command 
ng g c component-name ( g-> for generate, c-> component)


****now today will stop here
